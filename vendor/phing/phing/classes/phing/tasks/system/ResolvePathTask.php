/**
 * Task for resolving relative paths and setting absolute path in property value.
 *
 * This task was created to address a need for resolving absolute paths of files / directories.
 * In many cases a relative directory (e.g. "./build") is specified, but it needs to be treated
 * as an absolute path since other build files (e.g. in subdirs) should all be using the same
 * path -- and not treating it as a relative path to their own directory.
 *
 * <code>
 * <property name="relative_path" value="./dirname"/>
 * <resolvepath propertyName="absolute_path" file="${relative_path}"/>
 * <echo>Resolved [absolute] path: ${absolute_path}</echo>
 * </code>
 *
 * TODO:
 *      - Possibly integrate this with PackageAsPath, for handling/resolving dot-path paths.
