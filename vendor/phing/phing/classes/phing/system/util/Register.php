/**
 * Static class to handle a slot-listening system.
 *
 * Unlike the slots/signals Qt model, this class manages something that is
 * more like a simple hashtable, where each slot has only one value.  For that
 * reason "Registers" makes more sense, the reference being to CPU registers.
 *
 * This could be used for anything, but it's been built for a pretty specific phing
 * need, and that is to allow access to dynamic values that are set by logic
 * that is not represented in a build file.  For exampe, we need a system for getting
 * the current resource (file) that is being processed by a filterchain in a fileset.
 *
 * Each slot corresponds to only one read-only, dynamic-value RegisterSlot object. In
 * a build.xml register slots are expressed using a syntax similar to variables:
 *
 * <replaceregexp>
 *    <regexp pattern="\n" replace="%{task.current_file}"/>
 * </replaceregexp>
 *
 * The task/type must provide a supporting setter for the attribute:
 *
 * <code>
 *     function setListeningReplace(RegisterSlot $slot) {
 *        $this->replace = $slot;
 *  }
 *
 *  // in main()
 *  if ($this->replace instanceof RegisterSlot) {
 *        $this->regexp->setReplace($this->replace->getValue());
 *  } else {
 *        $this->regexp->setReplace($this->replace);
 *  }
 * </code>
